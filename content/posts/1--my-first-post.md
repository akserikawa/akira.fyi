## Hello world!

As the title says, this is my first ever blog post on the internet.
Pretty ironic considering I've spent the last +7 years writing software for a living.

Now that I remember... I actually used to have a Fotolog account back in the old days. The web was fucking amazing back then...

Anyway. This is also my first ever conscious attempt at improving my writing and communication skills.
Sometimes it's hard to convey a message when English is not your first language.

In this blog I will [brain vomit](https://chrisgrundemann.com/index.php/2011/brain-vomit/) on whatever topics I like, e.g., tech, films, music, pro sports (mostly cycling), lifestyle, entrepreneurship, personal experiences, etc., so expect a mix of everything.

Needless to say: all opinions here are my own 😮‍💨

Time to wrap things up for now. I have to keep learning about the [Hugo's](https://gohugo.io/) cool features to make this blog look beautiful.
And learn more [Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)!

I like this minimalistic UI design. And it has a dark mode 🌚

In the future I might add a Disqus integration so that you can share your thoughts in each post. That'd be cool.

See you soon! 🤗
